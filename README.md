in a line chart that represent the five food elements (Protein , Carbs , Fiber , Fats, calcium , potassium) that
exists in 100 grams.

First, Extract the features of the food entered (color histogram , texture features , shape features) then apply the segmentation function to get the area of the food element.
By using SVM model we classify the food.
finally, calculate the calories based on the mass which is calcuated from the volume that estimated from the area of the food and finger.
